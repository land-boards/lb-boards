WARNING!!! The &quot;GALer&quot; and &quot;GALerTest&quot; programs send data over your Amiga's
parallel port. This means: when you have a printer, digitizer, or
something else attached, it should be switched off or disconnected, since
it is possible that you may damage them.


I CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER OR PRERIPHERALS.



The &quot;GALer&quot; hardware and software has been running faultlessly on my A3000.
I have tested GALer on A1000, A3000 and A4000 machines. It should run on
all other Amigas too.
The circuit diagram is 100% fault free. With careful construction
there is no reason for anything going awry. Even so the construction should
be carried out by electronics freak (you should at least have soldering
experience, and be able to intelligently read circuit diagrams). More
information about the construction can be found in chapter III.


Note: This manual sparely covers the operational theory of GAL programming.
It is not a substitute for <a href="literature.html">further reading</a>.

If you already have long experience with digital circuitry, and really don't
care how a GAL is made, or how it works internally, then this manual together
with the examples should suffice to intelligently implement your GALs.
