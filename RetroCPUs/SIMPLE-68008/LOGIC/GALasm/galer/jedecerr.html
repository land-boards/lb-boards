<u>II.5.2 JEDEC File</u>

&quot;unexpected end of file&quot;
   The last thing in a JEDEC file should be either the file checksum or
   a '*'.


&quot;unknown command found&quot;
   There is a unknown command in your JEDEC file (see chapter JEDEC File for
   possible commands). In most cases the reason for this error message
   is a missing '*'.


&quot;bad format of number&quot;
   A dez. or hex. number is expected and found, but there are illegal
   characters in it.
   Example:  C1a#3       


&quot;number expected after command&quot;
   After this command a dez. or hex. number is expected but not found.


&quot;0 or 1 expected&quot;
   Fuses can be set to 0 or 1. Using another digit will cause this error.


&quot;can't find out type of GAL&quot;
   GALer can't identify for which type of GAL (GAL16V8 or GAL20V8) this
   JEDEC file is. But GALer must know this in order to program a GAL.


&quot;QF multible found&quot;
   In the JEDEC file the command QF is found multiple. This is not
   allowed.


&quot;QP multible found&quot;
   In the JEDEC file the command QP is found multiple. This is not
   allowed.


&quot;ending '*' expected&quot;
   GALer expects a '*' character.


&quot;after 'C' command no 'L' command allowed&quot;
   After the fuse checksum no change of fuses (L command) is allowed.


&quot;bad fuse checksum&quot;
   The fuse checksum is bad. The reason for this can be that you have
   changed some state of fuses with a text editor.


&quot;too many &#060;STX&#062; (= CTRL-B, 0x02) found&quot;
   The &#060;STX&#062; control character should be once at the beginning of the
   JEDEC file.


&quot;too many &#060;ETX&#062; (= CTRL-C, 0x03) found&quot;
   The &#060;ETX&#062; control character should be once at the end of the
   JEDEC file.


&quot;bad sequence of &#060;STX&#062;, &#060;ETX&#062;&quot;
   The first control character must be a &#060;STX&#062; then a &#060;ETX&#062; not vice versa.


&quot;after file checksum end of file expected&quot;
   There is a character after a file checksum which is not a Space, TAB
   or Carriage Return. This is not allowed.


&quot;bad fuse address (L... too short)&quot;
   It's easier to show an example:
          L0010 1011*
          L0013 0111*
      Address 13 is defined twice.


&quot;addresses skiped but no default value (F0/1*) defined&quot;
   It's easier to show an example:
          L0010 11*
          L0015 01*
    The fuses of the addresses 12, 13 and 14 are not defined and there
    is no F command which would define the values of missing fuses.


&quot;'*' expected&quot;
   '*' expected but not found (what else should I say here).


&quot;QF... and last fuse address (L...) are not equal&quot;
   QF defines the number of fuses in this JEDEC file (GAL16V8: 2194,
   GAL20V8: 2706). If the last fuse of a L command does not match
   to the QF command, this error will occur.


&quot;no values for the fuses found (no F0/1, L...)&quot;
   In your JEDEC file are no fuses defined. Such a file is useless
   and therefore rejected by GALer.


&quot;only QF2194 *, QF2706 *, QF3274 *, QF5892 * allowed&quot;
   There is a QF... command which fits to no GAL which is supported by
   GALer.

&quot;too many fuses found&quot;
   In your JEDEC file are too many fuses defined.


&quot;found several fuse checksumms&quot;
   In your JEDEC file are several fuse checksumms. This is not allowed.


&quot;selected type of GAL fits not to JEDEC file&quot;
   You have selected a to-be-programmed-GAL which does not fit to
   the JEDEC file.
