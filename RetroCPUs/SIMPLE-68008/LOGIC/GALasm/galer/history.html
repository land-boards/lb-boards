    V1.0:    Test version

    V1.1:    Intuition interface added

    V1.2:    cured a few bugs

    V1.3:  - cured some bugs in the GAL assembler. /name.E is no longer allowed.
           - The pin names of the last assembled files can be assigned to the
             indicated GAL.

    V1.4:  - Kick 2.0
           - new Intuition environment
           - support of A- and B-type GALs
           - new format of JEDEC files
           - new functions: verify of programmed GALs
                           test whether security fuse is set or not
                           compare GALs
                           optimizer for Boolean equations
                           reassembler
           - IMPORTANT CHANGE!!!:
              '/' in pin declaration is now considered in the equations

    V1.41  - support of locale.library and gadtools.library
           - req.library replaced by reqtools.library, reqtools.library is
             copyright by Nico Francois
           - Help available

    V1.5   - support of GAL22V10 and GAL20RA10
           - needs WB 2.0 or later
           - detects A- and B-type 16V8 and 20V8 GALs automatically
           - use of #, &amp;, ! for OR, AND and NOT is now possible
           - shortcuts changed
           - external editor can be called from GALer
           - comments in the source files can now be introduced by a ';'

    V1.5a  - this version is equal to version 1.5
             but now there is a layout included (see directory &quot;Layout&quot;)

    V1.5b  - improved timing, therefore the access time is slowed down
             significantly

    V1.5c  - bug removed, erasing of 22V10 GALs did not work

    V2.0   - new GUI (Magic User Interfac, MUI)
           - bugs in reassembler removed
               translation of GAL22V10 JEDEC files in source codes often failed
               and the handling of negations in tristate enable equations was
               wrong
           - bug in assembler removed
               feedback of GAL22V10 registered outputs was wrong

    V2.1   - Optimizer did not work at all in version 2.0 because of a
             typing error in the source code (I formated the source new
             in version 2.0 and by doing this a mistake occured - SORRY).
             Now it seems to be ok again.
