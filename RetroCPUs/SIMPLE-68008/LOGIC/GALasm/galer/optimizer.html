<u>II.2.7 Optimizer</u>

Boolean equations can be simplified very often, but for human beings
it is a hard way to do. A computer can do this much faster (in most
times).

The Optimizer of GALer tries to optimize Boolean equations by use of
the Quine-McCluskey algorithm. How this algorithm works can be read
in many books which deal with Boolean mathamatics, so it's not
described here. I just will described the usage of the Optimizer.

Hm, well, the usage of the Optimizer:

   Just select the menu <a href="menoptimizer.html">Optimizer</a> to start GALer's Optimizer.
   After this a file requester pops up. Now you have to select the
   <a href="sourcefile.html">source file</a> which equations you want to be optimized.
   After successfully loading this source file GALer starts to optimize
   the equations.

   GALer displays the original equation and the optimized one. If you
   are happy with the result of the optimization you should select the
   gadget 'use it'. Then the original equation is replaced by the
   optimized equation in your loaded source file.

   If you don't like the result of the optimization, you should select the
   gadget 'reject'. Then the original equation is not replaced.

   After trying to optimize all equations GALer will pop up a file requester
   again. Now you have to select a file name of your optimized source file.
   Please don't use the file name of the original source file for the
   optimized source file. Give the new file a new name, just like name_opt.pld
   instead of name.pld.


   Example of optimization:

     Original Boolean equation:

         X = /A*/C + A*/C + C*/D + /B*/C + /A*C*D + B*/D

     By GALer optimized Boolean equation:

         X = /C + /D + /A

   Both equations are equal, but the second one is much easier to read.


Not all equations can be simplified. It could be that a &quot;optimized&quot;
equation is more complicate than the original one. Just try it.
