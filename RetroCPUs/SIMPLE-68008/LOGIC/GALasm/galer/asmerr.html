<u>II.5.1 Assembler</u>

&quot;Line  1: type of GAL expected&quot;
   The first line of your source file must define for what type of GAL
   this source file is. So the first line must contain one of the
   following keywords: GAL16V8, GAL20V8, GAL16V8A, GAL20V8A


&quot;unexpected end of file&quot;
   Normaly this error occurs when there is no DESCRIPTION keyword
   at the end of your Boolean equations.


&quot;pin name expected after '/'&quot;
   A '/' must be followed by a pin name. If there is a '/' but no pin name
   this error will occur.


&quot;max. length of pin name is 8 characters&quot;
   Pin names are not allowed to be longer than 8 characters.


&quot;illegal character in pin declaration&quot;
   In a pin name is a character which is not allowed to use. Possible
   characters are: a..z, A..Z, 0..9, /


&quot;illegal VCC/GND assignment&quot;
   VCC and GND are keywords. It's not allowed to use these words for
   other pins. Use it only for the pins VCC and GND.


&quot;pn declaration: expected VCC at VCC pin&quot;
   The pin VCC must have the name VCC.


&quot;pin declaration: expected GND at GND pin&quot;
   The pin GND must have the name GND.


&quot;pin name defined twice&quot;
   In the pin declaration a pin name is used multiple.


&quot;illegal use of '/'&quot;
   Negations ('/') must be followed by a pin name. 


&quot;unknown pin name&quot;
   Within a Boolean equation is a undefined pin name.


&quot;NC (Not Connected) is not allowed in logic equations&quot;
   NC is a keyword for unused pins. So don't use this in your
   Boolean equations.


&quot;unknown suffix found&quot;
   A '.' must be followed by a T, E, R, CLK, ARST or APRST. This defines


&quot;'=' expected&quot;
   A '=' is expected but not found (what else should I say).


&quot;this pin can't be used as output&quot;
   You have tried to define a pin as output which can't be used as output.


&quot;same pin is defined multible as output&quot;
   It's easier to show an example:
     X = ...
     X = ...
   This brings up this error message.


&quot;before using .E, the output must be defined&quot;
   You have defined a Boolean equation for tristate enable but there
   was no Boolean equation for the trisate output.
   The order must be:
     name.T = ...
     name.E = ...

   Possibly you have done:
     name.E = ...
     name.T = ...
   this is wrong!


&quot;GAL22V10: AR and SP is not allowed as pinname&quot;
   When using a GAL22V10 AR and SP are keywords for the asynchronous reset
   and synchronous preset. So AR and SP is not allowed to be used as pin
   names.


&quot;.E, .CLK, .ARST and .APRST is not allowed to be negated&quot;
   The definitions for tristate control,... can't be negated.


&quot;mode 2: pins 12, 19 can't be used as input&quot;
   The GAL would be in mode 2. In this mode you can't define the pins
   12 and 19 as input pins. These pins do not have a feedback too. This
   means that the following equation is not allowed.

     a := pin 19
     b := pin 4
     y := pin 17

     a = b              a is output, b is input
     y = a * b          y is output
                        a is used as input, this is not allowed in mode 2
                        because there is on feedback

&quot;mode 2: pins 15, 22 can't be used as input&quot;
   The GAL would be in mode 2. In this mode you can't define the pins
   15 and 22 as input pins. These pins do not have a feedback too. This
   means that the following eqauation is not allowed.

     a := pin 22
     b := pin 4
     y := pin 17

     a = b              a is output, b is input
     y = a * b          y is output
                        a is used as input, this is not allowed in mode 2


&quot;tristate control is defined twice&quot;
   Example:    name.E = A * B
               name.E = C
   this is not allowed!


&quot;GAL16V8/20V8: tri. control for reg. output is not allowed&quot;
   When using a GAL16V8/20V8 it is not possible to define a tristate
   control for registered outputs.


&quot;tristate control without previous '.T'&quot;
   There is a tristate control for a combinational output.
   wrong:       name   = ...
                name.E = ...

   right:       name.T = ...
                name.E = ...


&quot;use GND, VCC instead of /VCC, /GND&quot;
   I think there is nothing to explain.


&quot;mode 3: pins 1,11 are reservated for 'Clock' and '/OE'&quot;
   Using register outputs causes mode 3 for the GAL. In this mode the
   pins 1 and 11 of a GAL16V8 can't be used by your own. These pins are
   reserved for Clock and /OE.


&quot;mode 3: pins 1,13 are reservated for 'Clock' and '/OE'&quot;
   Using register outputs causes mode 3 for the GAL. In this mode the
   pins 1 and 13 of a GAL20V8 can't be used by your own. These pins are
   reserved for Clock and /OE.


&quot;use of VCC and GND is not allowed in equations&quot;
   Expressions like  &quot;X = A * VCC&quot; are not allowed (and not necassary).


&quot;tristate control: only one product term allowed (no OR)&quot;
   In Boolean equations for tristate controls only one product
   term can be used. This means no ORs in your name.E=... equation.


&quot;too many product terms&quot;
   In this definition are too many product terms.


&quot;use of AR and SP is not allowed in equations&quot;
   AR and SP are keywords which can't be used in output definitions.


&quot;negation of AR and SP is not allowed&quot;
   AR and SP definitions can't be negated.


&quot;no equations found&quot;
   Sorry, but there are no Boolean equations in your source file. So GALer
   does not know what to do with your source file.


&quot;.CLK is not allowed when this type of GAL is used&quot;
   A clock definition is only allowed when a GAL20RA10 is used.


&quot;.ARST is not allowed when this type of GAL is used&quot;
   A .ARST definition is only allowed when a GAL20RA10 is used.
   

.APRST is not allowed when this type of GAL is used
   A .ARPST definition is only allowed when a GAL20RA10 is used.


&quot;GAL20RA10: pin 1 can't be used in equations&quot;
   Pin 1 of the GAL20RA10 is reserved for the preloading /PL.


&quot;GAL20RA10: pin 13 can't be used in equations&quot;
   Pin 13 of the GAL20RA10 is reserved for the output enable /OE.


&quot;AR, SP: no suffix allowed&quot;
   It's not allowed to add a suffix to AR, SP definitions.


&quot;AR or SP is defined twice&quot;
   A AR or SP definition is defined twice.


&quot;missing clock definition (.CLK) of registered output&quot;
   When using a GAL20RA10 all registered outputs must get a clock
   definition.


&quot;before using .CLK, the output must be defined&quot;
   At first you have to define the registered output by using .R before
   you can define the clock for this output.


&quot;before using .ARST, the output must be defined&quot;
   At first you have to define the registered output by using .R before
   you can define the asynchronous reset.


&quot;before using .APRST the output must be defined&quot;
   At first you have to define the registered output by using .R before
   you can define the asynchronous preset.


&quot;several .CLK definitions for the same output found&quot;
   You have defined more than one clock definition for the same output.


&quot;several .ARST definitions for the same output found&quot;
   You have defined more than one asynchronous reset definition for the
   same output.


&quot;several .APRST definitions for the same output found&quot;
   You have defined more than one asynchronous preset definition for the
   same output.


&quot;use of .CLK, .ARST, .APRST only allowed for registered outputs&quot;
   Well, use of .CLK, .ARST and .APRST is only allowed for registered
   outputs :-)
