<u>II.3 JEDEC File</u>

JEDEC means (J)oint (E)lectron (D)evice (E)nineering (C)ouncil.
This file is a ASCII file in which every bit which can be set in a
GAL is listed. The JEDEC file has the extension &quot;.jed&quot; and it's
generated by the GAL-Assembler.


The JEDEC file can start with any text until there is a asterisk (*).
The first '*' introduces the command field. The command field starts
with the first '*' and ends at the file end.
Within the command field are... (now be astonished) commands! A command
is introduced by one character and it ends with a '*' character.

All commands are optional. Not every command must be in a JEDEC file.
The <a href="assembler.html">GAL-Assembler</a> normaly uses: L, F and G commands (see below)


Possible commands are:


 N: This introduces a comment.
    Example:   N this is a comment *

               ^        ^          ^
               |        |          |
         command    any text    end of command



 F: You don't have to list all states of the fuses in the GAL. If you don't
    list all fuses GALer must know what the state of the missed fuses is.
    
    F0 *: not listed fuses are set to 0
    F1 *: not listed fuses are set to 1



 G: Security Fuse

    G0 *: don't set the security fuse after programming the GAL
    G1 *: ask user (you) whether to set the security fuse after
          programming the GAL or not


 L: L defines the address of a fuse and what the state of the fuse
    should be.

    Example:  L0000  10110111111111111111111111011111 *

        this means:  set fuse at address 0 to 1
                     set fuse at address 1 to 0
                     set fuse at address 2 to 1
                                .
                                .
                                .

    possible addresses are:

        GAL16V8, GA16V8A, GAL16V8B:
          0000-2047: matrix of fuses (AND-array)
          2048-2055: XOR bits
          2056-2119: signature
          2120-2127: AC1 bits
          2128-2191: product term disable bits
          2192     : SYN bit
          2193     : AC0 bit                    

        GAL20V8, GAL20V8A, GAL20V8B:
          0000-2559: matrix of fuses (AND-array)
          2560-2567: XOR bits
          2568-2631: signature
          2632-2639: AC1 bits
          2640-2703: product term disable bits
          2704     : SYN bit
          2705     : AC0 bit

        GAL22V10
          0000-5807: matrix of fuses (AND-array)
          5808-5827: S0/S1-bits of the OLMCs
          5828-5891: signature

        GAL20RA10
          0000-3199: matrix of fuses (AND-array)
          3200-3209: S0-bits of the OLMCs
          3210-3273: signature


 QF: Defines how many fuses in the JEDEC file are. A GAL16V8 has
     2194 fuses and a GAL20V8 has 2706 fuses. Now GALer can
     identify for which type of GAL this JEDEC file is.

     Example: QF2194 *



 C: C is followed by a 16 bit hex number which is the fuse checksum of
    the JEDEC file (see description of menu 'JEDEC file parameter').

    Example: C6402 *



 &#060;STX&#062;, &#060;ETX&#062;: These are control characters.
    &#060;STX&#062;: 0x02 = CTRL-B
    &#060;ETX&#062;: 0x03 = CTRL-C

    Your text editor displays this characters in this way:
      &#060;STX&#062;  &#002;
      &#060;ETX&#062;  &#003;
    &#060;STX&#062; defines the start of the JEDEC file and &#060;ETX&#062; the end of the
    JEDEC file. &#060;ETX&#062; is followed by the file checksum (see description
    of menu 'JEDEC file-parameter'). The file checksum is a 16 bit hex
    number.



 V: V introduces a test vector. GALer 1.4 does not support this. GALer
    interprets this command as a N command (comment).
