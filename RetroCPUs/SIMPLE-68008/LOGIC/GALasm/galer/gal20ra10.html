<u>I.2.3 The GAL20RA10</u>

The next and last GAL which I want to indroduce is the GAL20RA10. This
is also a second generation GAL, but this one is a special one. It is
not as universal as a GAL16V8, GAL20V8 or GAL22V10.


Here the pin designations:

                         GAL20RA10
                         ---- ----
                  /PL   1|       |24  +5V
                Input   2|       |23  Configurable Output Cell
                Input   3|       |22  Configurable Output Cell
                Input   4|       |21  Configurable Output Cell
                Input   5|       |20  Configurable Output Cell
                Input   6|       |19  Configurable Output Cell
                Input   7|       |18  Configurable Output Cell
                Input   8|       |17  Configurable Output Cell
                Input   9|       |16  Configurable Output Cell
                Input  10|       |15  Configurable Output Cell
                Input  11|       |14  Configurable Output Cell
                GND    12|       |13  /OE
                         ---------


The GAL20RA10 provides ten OLMCs. To each OLMC eight rows of the logic
matrix are connected. One row (product term) is needed for tristate
control again. Furthermore there are three product terms needed for
fully asynchronous control of the register set, reset and clock functions.
This means that there are four product terms left for the output definition.
The output enable product term is AND'ed with the input from pin 13 (/OE).
This allowes either a hard wired external control or a product term control,
or a combination of both.

Each OLMC has just one bit which can be programmed, the S0-bit (=XOR). This
bit is for the active polarity control. This means that there is no other
bit to define whether an output should be a registered or a tristated one.
But there is no bit needed to do this: if both is true the product term
of asynchronous reset and the product term of asynchronous preset, then the
register is switched off and the output becomes a &quot;normal&quot; tristate
output.

By use of pin 1, /PL (preload), all registered outputs can be preloaded.
This enhances the functional testability of the programmed GAL.
To preload a register do the following:

   1. supply a high to /PL and to /OE (so the registered outputs
      become high impedance outputs)

   2. impress the desired state on the register output pin

   3. pulse low /PL for at least 35ns

After this the registers will be loaded.
