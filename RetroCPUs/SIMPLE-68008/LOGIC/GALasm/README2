This is a modified version of GALasm 2.1.

It was modified by David Hovemeyer <david.hovemeyer@gmail.com>
so that when writing JEDEC files, end of line is indicated by
\r\n rather than just \n.  My GAL programmer (Wellon VP-190)
does not accept JEDEC files with bare \n characters in them.

I have compiled the modified version on Linux and Cygwin using
gcc, and the .jed files produced appear to be valid.  (The Wellon
software reports them as being valid, and successfully programs
22V10 devices with them.)
