=== SMITHBUG and FIGFORTH in ROM ===

* Combines SMITHBUG and FIGFORTH in ROM
** SMITHBUG in ROM from 0xC000-0xCFFF
** FIGFORTH in ROM from 0xD000-0xEFFF
** Vectors are at top of ROM from 0xFFF8-0xFFFF
* Uses a68 assembler
** Command line makes S-Record output
* Use srec_cat to shift from EPROM absolute addresses to 0x0000 as HEX file
* Fixes in FIG-Forth to get it to run from ROM
** The comments in the file indicated it could be run from ROM but the stack pointed to ORIG which is in ROM
** Fixed addresses of stack and I/O pointer to get it to work from ROM
* Assemble
