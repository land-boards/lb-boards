=== ROM BASIC assembly listing ===

* AS9 was used to assemble the BASIC listing
* Grant wrote a serial handler to control the text I/O, along with suitable Control-C break handling
* Includes commands from the "Extended" BASIC ROM (from the "Extended BASIC Unraveled II" book)
* The ROM in the SBC is fully working with all the commands in the Standard and Extended ROMS that are applicable to the SBC
* Assembled using as9 (see link later on this page) with the following command...

<pre>
as9 exbasrom.asm -now l s19
</pre>

* *-now" suppresses warnings
* "l" produces a lst file
* "s19" produces an s19 hex file
* If you use as9, you will probably get a "Null pointer assignment" message when it completes
** This can be ignored, and is a known bug with as9 that doesn't affect operation (according to the readme file that came with it)
