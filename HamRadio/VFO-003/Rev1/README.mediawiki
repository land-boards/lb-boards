=== Resources ===

* [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=VFO-003 Wiki page]
* [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php Land Boards circuit cards]
* Design files are kept here. Most are [http://www.kicad-pcb.org/display/KICAD/KiCad+EDA+Software+Suite/ Kicad designs].
** Kicad is an open source electronic design suite which includes professional quality schematic capture and board layout tools.

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by us based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not us.
