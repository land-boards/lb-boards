== Features ==

* [http://www.princeton.com.tw/Portals/0/Product/PT2399_1.pdf PT2399 Delay/Echo]
** The PT2399 is a CMOS single-chip echo processor IC
** A high sample rate ADC converts the analog data into a bitstream, which is then stored in internal 44Kbit RAM
** After processing, the bitstream is de-modulated by DAC and lowpass filter
** The internal VCO clock frequency determines the overall delay duration
** The user can easily modify the VCO frequency by changing the external resistance
* Eurorack 3U, 6HP card
* Built on [[ER-PROTO-02]] card
* PT2399 has a maximum current of 30mA
* Jacks
** J5 IN
** J6 OUT
* Controls
** RV1 In/Out mix
** RV2 Delay Length
** RV3 - Input Attenuator
** RV4 - Output Gain
* 10 pin Eurorack power jack
