== Features ==

* This is a diode ladder VCF - original design by Moritz Klein, with a couple of small adaptions made by [https://github.com/tkilla64/eurorack/tree/main/diode-vcf T Killa]
* There are two CV inputs
** CV1 with an attenuator to control the amount
** CV2 with an attenuverter so it's possible to invert the signal as well as controlling the amount of modulation
* The filter is a low-pass filter only
* 3U tall
* 6 HP (30mm) wide
* Uses [[ER-PROTO-02]] controls cards
