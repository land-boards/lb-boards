# Offshoots

Offshoots is an easy to DIY, Arduino Nano based adaptation of
[Mutable Instruments' Branches](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/branches/). Heavily inspired by [sound-force.nl's Through-Hole Braids](https://sound-force.nl/?page_id=3179) and [Quinie.nl's NanoGris](https://github.com/Quinienl/NanoGris).

Only functional difference with Branches is Offshoots doesn't "remember" which output is high when leaving latch mode and coming back to it again. It needs a new input to latch to one of the outputs.

The photos included are of the prototype version of the board. I messed up the silkscreen, but that has been corrected. If you have some boards made, please send me photos! I also corrected a couple of other minor errors, so technically, this version of the board on github is untested, but I am very confident it works as intended.
