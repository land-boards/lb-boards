This is a project to build a low cost clone of the Mutable Instruments Peaks. With the code from Mathias Levy's project $peaks which uses the dual pwm feature of the STM32 and some changes to the code by him. This page outlines the hardware design of a module very similar to the Peaks with the hardware changes by Mathias. Ending in a very low cost version of the MI Peaks.
