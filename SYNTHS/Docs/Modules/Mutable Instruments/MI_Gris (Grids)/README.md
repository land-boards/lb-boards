# Gris
A throughhole version of the Mutable Instruments Grids, a remake as close to the original as possible.

This is simply put just a remake of the Grids by Mutable Instruments but with throughhole components and an Arduino Nano as the MCU. The schematics is a redrawn copy of the original by Emilie Gilet, nothing added, nothing removed. But it had to be redrawn for the sake of creating the new PCBs... The 5v power part has been replaced with the onboard regulator on the Arduino Nano to keep down costs.

There is a video about the creation of this kit here:

And you can buy a kit or only the PCBs at a reasonable price in my Tindieshop here:
