# Braids
Front panel for MI Braids eurorack module - I removed the THT from the front panel in the published Gerber file.

All credits go to the awesome Ã‰milie Gillet of Mutable Instruments under the creative commons cc-by-sa.
I just translated her design to a simplified version that can be fabricated at contract pcb manufacturers like JLCPCB.

Also check out sound-force.nl for a through-hole DIY version of Braids.
