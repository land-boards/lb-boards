# kicad-3d-models-in-freecad
kicad 3d models in freecad:
this is a repo of 3d models done in freeCAD and exported in STEP and in VRML to be used in kicad 3d-viewer and in kicad StepUp tool
with kicad StepUp it is possible to align the 3d-viewer and the 3d PCB and modules board in STEP, so to be able to obtain a perfectly identical represaentation in kicad 3d-viewer and in FreeCAD or MCAD software.

The only requirements, different from the actual way of using kicad is to substitute Wings3D with FreeCAD
and, obviously, populate the 3D models with STEP lib...

The repo will have models starting from a FreeCAD project modeled in mm with a standar origin and orientation

                                            -----> STEP model exported (union of parts)

                                            -----> VRML model exported (scaled 1/2.54)


# REQUIREMENTS
- [x] FreeCAD 0.17
- [x] CadQuery 1.2.0 

If you would like to share your models, I'll be happy to add these to the 3D repo!!! :)

thank you for any suggestion and feedback,

Maurice
