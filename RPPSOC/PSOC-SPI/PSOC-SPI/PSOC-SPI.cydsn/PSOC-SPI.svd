              <description>This bit is used for gating system clock for the blocks core logic that is not associated with AHB interface. Clock is made available to the core logic only when this bit is set to 1 and the input pin ext_clk_en is also active. If either of them is not active, the blocks core logic does not receive the system clock.</description>

              <description>When this bit is set to a '1', hardware address compare is enabled. On an address match, an interrupt is generated, CSR register bit 3 is set, and the clock is stalled until the CPU writes a 0 into the CSR register bit 3. The address is automatically ACKed on a match. On an address mismatch,no interrupt is generated, clock is not stalled, and bit 3 in the CSR register is set. The CPU must write a 0 into the CSR register bit 3 to clear it. The address is automatically NACKed on a mismatch. You must configure the compare address in the ADR register. When this bit is set to a '0', software address compare is enabled. An interrupt is generated, the clock is stalled, and CSR register bit 3 is set when the received address byte is available in the Data register; to enable the CPU to do a firmware address compare. The clock is stalled until the CPU writes a 0 into the CSR register bit 3. The functionality of this bit is independent of the data buffering mode.</description>
